# Spyro: A Hero's Tail Archipelago
An implementation of the Archipelago randomizer for Spyro: A Hero's Tail (PS2)

## What is randomized?
Currently, randomization will apply to the 40 Dark Gems, 100 Light Gems and 80 Dragon Eggs, as well as the various abilities you can collect such as Double Jump and Wing Shield.

## Setup Guide
TODO, but the patches will only apply to the U.S. release (specifically, ``SLUS-20884``).
